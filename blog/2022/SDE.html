        <h2>SDE: Software Development Extremism</h2>
				<p><small>Or, as I like to call it, <b>Hot Take Bonanza</b></small></p>
        <p>
          One thing that truly fascinates me over my time of reading and
          watching videos by many folks is the extremely 2 sided camps of
          software. There is the middle ground of everyday webdev normies, but
          that's normal and the uninteresting bit. <br />
          You see, these two camps, from what I have seen are:
          <ul>
              <li>Linux/FOSS Purists</li>
              <li>Game-dev, Performant software purists</li>
          </ul>
          Both camps have small similarity, and also huge differences. I guess what I'm trying to say 
          is that it's rather interesting to see this, abit comical as well that a situaition like this 
          exists. I should mention that for the majority of the points I agree with both camps. <br>
          Generalising and combining a group of people who are passionate about good quality software 
          is also bad, because that is the point of both sides. <b>To have good quality, bloat less, and 
					high performance software</b>. It's also a fair point; alot of people have no idea how fast 
					their computers are, or their phones even, and to be honest have been spoiled by not only the web 
					but just bad software and unoptimized code to make them think that a better pc will fix all their issues.
					While this isn't true for a majority of the games, because that is one industry still producing 
					competent software that runs blazingly fast, this is the case for just about all things web. We're getting 
					there with the web, too, but that's another thing, and I've steered away from the point.
					<br><i>On with the camps</i>

				<h3>The Stallman FOSS Bloat-less Enthusiast Foundation</h3>
				<p>So, this is the most interesting, actual rabbit hole of bloat-less, spyware-less, open source, 
					free software. You see, initially, it was Richard Stallman who introduced the notion of open 
					source software, software that is not propietary and the users of which know and can see 
					all that the softwares they use are doing. He arguably had the greatest impact on our software 
					world, which still permeates all open source git repositories to this day. Now I haven't researched
					the start of the open source movement, so I can't say if he was alone in this, I'm sure he wasn't, 
					but you can do that search on your own. Anyways... so the linux foss enthusiast community has 
					a motto or a set of conditions for software they consider good, useful and meaningful.
					<ul>
						<li>FOSS: Free Open Source Software</li>
						<li>Follows Unix Philosophy</li>
					</ul>
					Now, you know FOSS, the title is self-explanatory, but I'll explain the <b>unix philosophy</b>.
				</p>
				<h4>The Unix Philosophy</h4>
				<p>The unix philosophy states, that software should be simple, it should do one thing, and it should 
					do that one thing really well. That is it.
				</p>
				<p>Now, what's interesting is how far this community is willing to go with that philosophy. So, 
					firstly, following FOSS means,<br>
					<b>you stick to only linux</b>, I agree with that, windows sucks, and I hate 
					apple and microsoft, as any sane man should. Think more about this though, and you'll realise, this also
					means that you stick to open source browsers (which is easy), you don't use websites like 
					facebook, twitter, instagram, or any other bloatware (that's also easy). 
					Well, if/when you use this, then you make sure to have somewhat strong anti-tracking tools/browser 
					settings, or use these websites with FOSS front-ends, that will atleast protect you from the 
					front-end tracking they do (and they do that alot) and to some extent cookies.<br>
					Allow me to emphasise though, only foss means <b>Only FOSS</b>, and this also includes your 
					email client, any communication platform you use, any cloud hosting, any storage solution, 
					any piece of code you run, has to be FOSS. <b>Why?</b>, well the argument is actually
					pretty sensible, you can't tell what proprietary software is doing, and it can and sure as 
					hell, does and will track you. It would be stupid of companies to not spy on you and profit off 
					of any data you have. And you're an even bigger chicken for thinking that they won't do it, 
					that's just naive and foolish. <br>
					Here's where it gets fun though. This extends to even the kernal, and any piece of code your laptop runs. 
					A big gripe with alot of people is the spyware of the intel management engine, and a similar tool 
					for amd. These are piece of code that your motherboard runs regardless, which gives this companies, 
					complete and total control of your entire system. It's described, rightfully so, as a backdoor into your 
					entire machine. But....I'm sure they won't do anything harmful, I mean why would they, they just make 
					processors. What could they or any company they are affiliated with or are in cahoots with, possibly 
					do from complete control of our system.<br>
					Don't fret, we've got something more fun. <b>The unix philosophy</b>. If you think the FOSS philosophy 
					was tough, buddy I have news for you. The extent people are willing to go to use code that isn't bloat, 
					is for anyone outside looking in, quite literally insane. Although they'd argue we are the one's 
					insane here. Take for example, a big gripe people have with linux is how much bloat alot of the software is. 
					Most common tools, <b>Sudo, and SystemD are bloat</b>. They argue, whilst still making sense, that firstly, 
					sudo as its used is bloat for everyday users, it does many things for sys administration, we need something 
					alot simpler. But, thats a minor point, a bigger thing is this thing called systemD, which people state, is 
					bloat software that tries to manage your entire system, and has been the bane of my youtube recommendation 
					system with that one guy's video getting recommended everyday titled, 
					<a href="https://youtu.be/o_AIw9bGogo">the tragedy of system D</a>. You see systemD basically is a suite of 
					daemons, that manage your core system functionality from boot, to ensure that all your devices, drivers, 
					clocks, any settings you can expect from a normal, functional system, work automatically without hassle. 
					Now purists argue, it does too much for a system that is supposed to just init your system, and are willing 
					to switch their os to one that does not use systemD. As I said, this is all bizarre yet interesting.

				<h3>Performance Extremists</h3>
				<p>I wouldn't even call this group extremists, but these are people who write good, performant and functional software, 
					or have experience with writing it, and are fed up with the current industry "standards" or "practices". They're 
					actually more sensible and make points the mainstream dev, might agree with. Then again, I might be expecting too much 
					from the mainstream dev. Their requirement is, 
					<ul>
						<li>Software should be performant</li>
						<li>Code should be written as simply as one can, without any convoluted practices that pollute it.</li>
					</ul>
					Both of these are self-explanatory, what I found funny is that, extremists in this end do despise windows, but consider 
					it superior to the buggy mess (not true), that is linux, and consider open source software to be trash. They consider that 
					the standards of code acceptance and just software that comes out of open source work is also pretty bad. I think it's 
					a generalisation and an oversight, but this is where the two sides agree, most software is trash, that is true, but you 
					have to go into the rabbit hole to find actually good software. Lastly, they don't care much about proprietary software,
					they are just programmers who care about programming, thats it.
