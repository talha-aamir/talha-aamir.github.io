      <h1>Turning Down The Noise</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          One of the biggest problems I or rather we all face is the excess of
          noise. As an engineer there is a constant barrage of things for me to
          learn. Furthermore, as someone interested in a plethora of topics
          sometimes that can be rightly, frustrating and overwhelming. Every
          step of the way you get to think that maybe I should be focusing on A,
          B, C topics. With engineering it doesn't help that within each of the
          A, B and C topics there is a further continously updating stream of
          topics, so it always feels like a <b>lose-lose</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used to have a good strategy for dealing with this. Priotize things, arrange them 
            in a list and you will eventually get to work on the things you want in a 
            very organized and sensible manner. Recently, I've been working hard and then 
            playing games. So, I've had little time to work on the side-projects I've got 
            going or the ones I'd like to start. I realized unfortunately that the same problems, 
            persisted in games, where you just keep getting a constant barrage of games 
            coming at you daily, and you're constantly thinking either:
            <ul>
                <li>I wanna play that, Or</li>
                <li>I'd like to play that</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            You couple this with constantly interacting with people daily, and eventually 
            you just run of any energy you have to spare. Interacting and navigating 
            the lines of dealing with people itself, takes a lot of energy and past a point 
            just gets annoying. In all of this, I find the best measure I take and has always 
            helped me has been to just <b>walk away</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Walking away has been the most rejuvenating habit I have had. Getting away from 
            firstly, people, opens up a lot of room and time. You no longer feel compelled or 
            have any reason to talk or answer (unless of course urgent). Doing so, 
            you spend more time with your thoughts as well as with yourself. I found it 
            really beneficial as I've been mostly looking at things from a fresh angle, I 
            find I have alot of time to myself, and then look inwards to find what are the 
            things I want to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's been pretty relaxing, I've only applied it to people, and to an extent games, 
            but I find that now would be a good time to apply it to other things, specifically, 
            engineering related things. Make a list, prioritize it, work through it slowly and 
            hopefully fulfill my needs of being creative in a more sustainable manner. Normally, 
            I have been fine at dealing with it, but because it's been now a month since I last 
            worked on a sideproject which itself is a very short amount of time, I feel the need 
            to work on something again. I have a list prepared so the best way would be to 
            prioritize it and work through it. Which perhaps is another thing I should write about. 
            Prioritizing things in an achieveable manner.
