      <h2>SAAP: Software As A Poison</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          I came up with this when I was making tea. Thinking about an actually
          snarky title to write for my blog. It's not far from how I feel about
          software, so I stuck with it. I'll clarify this abit more I guess, and
          maybe expand upon this. Software is poison is a very broad statement,
          <b>and an even bolder claim!</b>.<br />
          The software that I call poison, is basically:
          <ul>
              <li>Software that is just shit</li>
              <li>Software that is very slow</li>
              <li>Software that is meant to be written in a short amount of 
                  time. 
                  <small>
                      Literally every startup product 
                      <i>(for the most part)</i>
                  </small>
              </li>
              <li>Software that is filled with classes and/or 
                  <i>(since correlation does not equal causation)</i>
                  shows that the devs prioritized 
                  code "organization" and "scalability" above everything else.
                  <small>I despise this the most</small>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Software with the user as a host 
                  <small>to leech off of</small> 
                  model
              </li>
              <li>Finally, Proprietary Software 
                  <small>Satans favorite</small>
              </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Granted, I have described alot over here, and as much as you expect me to explain all of it, 
            I expect that are you think about it, you'll understand, for some I mean. I'm not trying to
            come off as a pretentious douche, but I'm also not doing a great job of not appearing as one. 
            Let's speedrun the simple ones.

          <h3>
              The Self-explanatory causes of my frustration
          </h3>
          <p>This list includes 
              <em>
                  Software that is shit, Software that is very slow, Software that 
                  is meant to be written in a short amount of time
                </em>.
                I actually would be bemused and slightly angry ngl, if you defended this. To which then, 
                I would actually not even spend time arguing. But, all of these three things are essentially 
                the same. Software meant to be written in a short amount of time, is going to be slow, often 
                very slow, its going to be a mess entirely, its going to then by definition be shit. Let's 
                practice patience and acceptance everytime we see this, because <b>sometimes</b> that's 
                just the reality of most of our jobs, atleast mine, <i>because I do work in a <b>fast-paced</b> 
                environment</i>.
                <small>And let's try to write as little of this category as we can.</small>
                <br>
                Alright, now for the more <i>up for debate, philosophical and subjective</i> arguments 
                for hating <b>certain</b> software categories.

          <h3>Form over Function Software</h3>
          <p>This is the reality, of just about everyone working in software, and I mean I'm not the 
              first one to say this, infact its at this point just cringe to shit talk classes. Which 
              is also why I feel just wierd writing about this. But, I'll explain my thoughts, not for classes, 
              but for <b>Form over Function</b> software. <br>
              There were times when I would excessively get bored by the banality of my work. Particularly by the fact that 
              I am writing code a monkey could write, and in those times, I would start thinking about what would be 
              the best way to write this code. No, not in terms of performance, but rather, the best way to 
              <b>Format</b> my functions, what should be the flow, linear, all in a function. How about some subscriptions 
              to handle and create some data services, 
              <i> 
                  because that's how far we've come with the hell that we've created
              </i>. 
              And this isn't just with my particular example. An open source project I tried getting into, had the most
              obscure and overengineered codebase, with some utterly confusing middlewares to try and handle parsing
              and modding, alot of python mixed with cython mixed with modern c++ because that was considered <em>GOOD!</em> 
              technical design. Things like these actually make me sick, because you really have to work hard and turn an 
              actual blind eye to alot of things for this to happen. It's not as sophisticated as you think, especially when 
              it takes <b>5x</b> the time to get accustommed to it, and equally long to work on it. Take for an example actual 
              good software, written with performance and simplicity in mind, the two most important things 
              <a href="https://st.suckless.org/" target="_blank">Suckless Terminal</a> <i>An actual simple software that does 
              the thing its supposed to</i>. A terminal written in 2000 lines of code, completely and easily customisable, 
              and understandable since everything is simple, and in one language, in the most basic and performant 
              implementation.

        <h3>Proprietary Leeches</h3>
        <p>
          This last category, isn't something everyone would agree with. Infact not alot of people would understand 
          or even be willing to understand the model. Maybe they do understand, but the fact that this is the reality 
          of just about every piece of software today, is not only infruriating but also saddening <i>to an extent</i>.
          Lets break it down:
          <h4>The Leechers</h4>
          Software today, I mean look at your phone, is designed to force you to be addicted to it. 
          <b>To be addicted to the App</b>. It tries its best to force its way into your life. Notifying you just about 
          every stupid minute any bland situation comes up. I mean it's not enough we already had a better system for 
          notifications, <b>via RSS feeds</b>, and companies just messed that up since that provided users with more 
          freedom to not be tied to their platform. <b>sigh...</b> I think I've explained my frustrations well enough.
          <h4>Proprietary Software</h4>
          Lastly, the bane of my existence, proprietary software. I'm pretty sure you won't find anything wrong with it.
          I mean why would you, it's only software that does absolutely nothing you can control or be aware of. I mean it
          is perfectly fine and normal, its not even your right to know what the piece of code you run on the device 
          that hosts your most private and personal details does, why don't we all just bath out in the open,
          give our friendly neighbours <i>aka all the companies we're helping profit off of us</i>, even more details about 
          us. Why wouldn't you literally sell yourself for just some convenience! For them it's just like taking candy 
          from a baby, because thats how things are <em>apparantly</em>
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This was a healthy way of exhibiting a few of my frustations, not just with software, but companies and people who
          create and consume it. As for a solution, it's not really my problem or concern, I just know what I value more
          and what needs to be done to respect those values, so I can live through this situation happily. I'm starting
          to limit my consumption of all <em>free</em> products, minimising phone usage, or of any propriety software as well.
          There's still alot that I need to do, but there's also a lot that I have already done, so I'm making some progress, 
          and am satisfied with what I have achieved.
