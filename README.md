# Welcome to my digital abode
For a long time, I have wanted to have my own blog site, somewhere I can post  
my thoughts, ideas or things. I was usually put off by the amount of effort  
and grunt work such a task (mantaining a blog site would take) would take.  

## The Pure Site
As the header points, this site is meant to be pure. It will be a pure html  
and css site, without javascript. That means its just basic html pages,  
and those would barely be an mb per file. There are thus many things I dont need  
to care about and many that excite me.  

## Exciting Opportunities
I want to make a heavily simplistic site, but one that looks great. I think my  
previous portfolio was a good mix, it was dark mode but it had the rad style  
I really dig. The only issue that had was some of the dynamic cool styles I made  
really couldn't scale well. The code was a mess, even though that was a very  
simplistic, similar to this site,  all built without js.  
If you are so inclined you can check it out yourself [here](https://sarcxd.github.io).  

## Conclusion
This will be fun and  
*TODO*  
I shall one day move this to an independant muh self hosted site
