          This is what it says, quite literally a line drawing program. It's the
          first thing I wrote in raylib, and the main thing to learn here was
          interpolation between two pixels, to create a line. I used DDA, since
          it seemed simple and convenient.

          <br />
          This is the second game I made in raylib. This was more fun. It's my
          own take on an overdone endless runner formula. Main things I learnt
          here were well, firstly some c coding, and secondly a bunch of vector
          math especially with regards to collision detection. I learnt about
          something called <b>Barycentric Coordinates</b>, which was quite fun,
          it's used for collision detection basically, inside a triangle.
