        <h3>Why this website?</h3>
        <p>
          Well, I really really enjoy talking about things. I also enjoy
          learning new things. And I learn or rather seek to learn a bunch of
          new things. These are things that I find fun and interesting, and I
          think like minded people would enjoy these, and feel the same way
          about it. Maybe it's not even that, maybe these things will pique
          someone's interest. Either works.
