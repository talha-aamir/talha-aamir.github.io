        <h3>Why this website?</h3>
        <p>
          Well, I enjoy learning new things. I learn or rather seek to learn a
          bunch of new things. I then also like talking about these things, and
          I think like minded people would enjoy these, and feel the same way
          about it. Maybe it's not even that, maybe these things will pique
          someone's interest. Either works.
